// ****TO-DO:
//	-> this one is pretty similar to the forward shading algorithm (Phong NM) 
//		except it happens on a plane, given images of the scene's geometric 
//		data (the "g-buffers"); all of the information about the scene comes 
//		from screen-sized textures, so use the texcoord varying as the UV
//	-> declare point light data structure and uniform block
//	-> declare pertinent samplers with geometry data ("g-buffers")
//	-> use screen-space coord (the inbound UV) to sample g-buffers
//	-> calculate view-space fragment position using depth sample
//		(hint: modify screen-space coord, use appropriate matrix to get it 
//		back to view-space, perspective divide)
//	-> calculate and accumulate final diffuse and specular shading
