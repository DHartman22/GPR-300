Disclaimer: When the program builds, it has a chance to fail. However, these steps have produced the greatest amount of success.

How to use the program:
  1. Open the program, click on the "Build" tab, and click on "Build Solution".
  2. Click on "Windows Debugger". Two windows should open up: a black window, and a white window.
  3. In the white window, click on the file tab, and select "Full Rebuild & Load"

If the program doesn't work, repeat these instructions. It should work on the second or third attempt.
